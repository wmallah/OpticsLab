% Discuss the purpose of the experiment
Understanding how the concentration of sugar in solution has practical applications in medicine. Currently, testing blood-sugar levels requires drawing a small blood sample for chemical testing. An application of research into the effect of solution sugar concentration on light polarization would be for testing blood sugar levels in diabetics non-invasively.


The method used to polarize a white-light source consisted of two Polaroid polarizers: an individual polarizer produces linearly polarized light by selective absorption. More specifically, our method used two polarizers to determine both the polarization of light entering the solution beaker and the light exiting the solution beaker. Knowing both these polarizations allowed us to determine the change in polarization through the solution beaker.
