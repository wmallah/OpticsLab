%% Address how this method was tested accurately and precisely measure chnage in polarization and quantify the uncertainties associated with its use

% Discuss the purpose of the experiment
Understanding how the concentration of sugar in solution has practical applications in medicine. Currently, testing blood-sugar levels requires drawing a small blood sample for chemical testing. Reasearch into the effect of sugar concentration in solution is promising for non-invasive testing of blood sugar levels in diabetics.

% Talk about the findings of other researchers
Many other biomedical researches have probed the affect of sugar concentration on the polarization of light. These same researches tested the effect of other factors on the polarization of light, such as the incident angle of the polarized light on the solution. One specific study found the change in polarization of light to be linear with respect to both sugar concentration in solution as well as polarizer angle of incident light\cite{Firsdausi2018}.

The method used to polarize a white-light source consisted of two Polaroid polarizers: an individual polarizer produces linearly polarized light by selective absorption. More specifically, our method used two polarizers to determine both the polarization of light entering the solution beaker and the light exiting the solution beaker. Knowing both these polarizations allowed us to determine the change in polarization through the solution beaker (discussed further in the Methods Section).
