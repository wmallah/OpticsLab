% Discussion of additional uncertainties and potential sources of error.
%% External light sources: phone flashlight to see angle of polarizer and intensity meter, computer light
%% Swirling of water in beaker
%% Amount of light going through different sized beakers directly into the fiberglass opitcal cable
%% Medium beaker was broken and had to be replaced prior to solution 2 experiment

There were several possible sources of uncertainty unrelated to error in measurement. The first was the use of external light sources.
A phone flashlight was used to see the angle of the polarizer and the intensity meter. The computer light was also on during the trials in order to input data
directly into code. Although the phone flashlight was necessary to make measurements, its effect on the intensity meter could have been minimized by shielding 
the fiber optic cable from the flashlight's light. The computer light was also necessary to input data, but it was not in the direct line of sight of the intensity meter.

A secondary source of uncertainty could be the swirling of the solution in the beaker. The swirling of the solution could have caused light to scatter unevenly, 
leading to either higher or lower intensity readings. The possible source of uncertainty stemming from the swirling of the solution could have been minimized 
by allowing the solution to settle longer prior to taking measurements.

A tertiary source of uncertainty could be the amount of light traveling through each differently sized beakers directly into the fiberglass optical cable. 
We are unsure if there would be any direct way to minimize the possible uncertainty stemming from the amount of light traveling through each differently sized beaker.
However, this uncertainty can be discarded when comparing intensity measurements between trials with the same beaker size.

A final possible source of uncertainty stemmed from the medium beaker being broken and needing to be replaced prior to the solution 2 experiment. Although unlikely,
the replacement beaker could have had slightly different optical properties than the original medium beaker.
