Investigation on the affect of sugar concentration in solution on the polarization of incident light has applications in the medical field, including advancement in technologies used to test blood sugar levels non-invasively. The phase shift discovered, which was determined by fitting the intensity of light versus polarization graphs, is the phase shift of the plane of polarization. In our study, we found that the polarization of light changes linearly with respect to both sugar concentration and path length through solution. Via computational analysis, it was found that the phase changes at a rate of $0.023 \pm 0.001$ radians per gram millimeter per milliliter.
