Investigation of how sugar concentration in solution affects the polarization of incident light has applications in the medical field, including advancement in technologies used to test blood sugar levels non-invasively. Assuming that change in polarization is proportional to change in phase we found that the polarization of light changes linearly with respect to both sugar concentration and path length through solution. Through computational analysis, it was found that the polarization changes at a rate of $0.02319773$ radians per gram millimeter per milliliter.
